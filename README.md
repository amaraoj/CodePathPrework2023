Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
- I would construct an app that would be able to help local hairstylists and people interested in hair services connect in one place. They could gain reviews of a stylist in the area (or in general) and dictate if that hairstylist works for them. To incentivise local clientele, the hairdressers could use this app to promote themselves to locals and pay a subscription to reach a larger audience. Some features I'd like to have on the app is the ability for clients to message hairdressers directly in the app, the ability to see and filter reviews, and block certain hairstylists from showing up on their feed. 

## Notes

Some challenges I had during the creation of this app is the difference between an outlet connection and a action connection. The instruction say, "IBAction" but on my IDE, I saw that I was given the option of outlet first. So I had to double check on if that was the right outlet to use, and that took roughly 5 minutes. After that, I understood it was the action connection I wanted, so that's the only challenge I faced.
